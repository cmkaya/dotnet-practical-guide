# Methods

A method in C# is a block of code that performs a specific task, and it can be declared with a return type, a method name, and a method body. You can call methods in C# to execute their code. Methods can have parameters and can return values, and there are also built-in methods available in C#.

## Points to Remember

- A method in C# is a block of code that performs a specific task, making programs more organized and reusable.
- To declare a method in C#, you specify its return type, method name, and method body enclosed in curly braces.
- Methods can be called in C# using their names, and you can pass arguments to them.
- You can use the `void` keyword as the return type for methods that don't return a value.
- Methods can return values, and the return type should match the type of value being returned.
- You can pass parameters to methods, allowing them to accept input values.
- Method overloading in C# allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists, making it easier to work with different input types.
